     * Possible device dsp properties:
     *   A dsp is a black box fpga component found between
     *   the over-the-wire data and the codec pins.
     *
     *   The host rate can be modified to control resampling.
     *   Resampling can take the form of decimation, interpolation,
     *   or more complex fractional resampling techniques.
     *   As usual, read back the host rate after setting it
     *   to get the actual rate that was set (implementation dependent).
     *
     *   A dsp can also shift the digital stream in frequency.
     *   Set the shift property and read it back to get actual shift.
